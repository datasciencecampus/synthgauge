.. py:function:: kway_marginals(real, synth, k=3, trials=100, bins=100, seed=None)

   The first generic measure based on similarity of k-way marginals.

   In essence, calculate the summed absolute difference in density
   across an array of randomly sampled k-way marginals. Transform and
   summarise these deviations to give a single score between 0 and 1.
   These extremes represent the worst and best case scenarios,
   respectively.

   The NIST competition utilised 3-way marginals only. Details can be
   found at https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2151.

   :param real: Dataframe containing the real data.
   :type real: pandas.DataFrame
   :param synth: Dataframe containing the synthetic data.
   :type synth: pandas.DataFrame
   :param k: Number of features to include in each k-way marginal. Default
             uses 3 (as done in the NIST competition).
   :type k: int, default 3
   :param trials: Maximum number of marginals to consider to estimate the overall
                  score. If there are fewer `k`-way combinations than `trials`,
                  tries all. Default uses 100 (as done in the NIST competition).
   :type trials: int, default 100
   :param bins: Binning method for sampled numeric features. Can be anything
                accepted by `numpy.histogram`. Default uses 100 bins (as done in
                the NIST competition).
   :type bins: int or str, default 100
   :param seed: Random number seed. If `None`, results will not be reproducible.
   :type seed: int or None, default None

   :returns: **score** -- The mean transformed sum absolute deviation in k-way densities.
   :rtype: float


.. py:function:: hoc(real, synth, trials=300, prob=0.1, seed=None)

   A measure based on Higher Order Conjunctions (HOC).

   This measure compares the relative sizes of randomly selected pools
   of "similar" rows in the real and synthetic data. This measure of
   similarity is defined across a set of randomly genereated test
   cases applied to each dataset. Each test case consists of a set of
   rules.

   The :math:`i`-th test calculates the fraction of records satisfying
   its rules in the real data, :math:`f_{ri}`, and the synthetic,
   denoted :math:`f_{si}`. Their dissimilarity in test :math:`i` is
   quantified as:

   .. math::

       d_i = \ln\left(\max(f_{si}, 10^{-6})\right) - \ln(f_{ri})

   These dissimilarities are summarised as:

   .. math::

       \Delta = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i^2}

   where :math:`N` is the number of test cases. Finally, this is
   transformed to a HOC score:

   .. math::

       HOC = \max \left(0, 1 + \frac{\Delta}{\ln(10^{-3})}\right)

   This measure is bounded between 0 and 1, indicating whether the
   datasets are nothing alike or identical based on the test cases,
   respectively. In the original text this score is multiplied by 1000
   to make it human-readable. Full details are available in
   https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.TN.2151.

   :param real: Dataframe containing the real data.
   :type real: pandas.DataFrame
   :param synth: Dataframe containing the synthetic data.
   :type synth: pandas.DataFrame
   :param trials: Number of test cases to create. Default of 300 as in the
                  competition.
   :type trials: int, default 300
   :param prob: Probability of any column being included in a test case. Default
                of 0.1 as in the competition.
   :type prob: float, default 0.1
   :param seed: Random number seed. If `None`, results will not be reproducible.
   :type seed: int or None, default None

   :returns: **score** -- The overall HOC score.
   :rtype: float

   .. rubric:: Notes

   It is possible that some test cases will be "empty", i.e. when no
   columns are selected. In this scenario, the score for that case will
   be `np.nan` rather than it being resampled.
