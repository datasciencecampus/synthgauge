# SynthGauge

SynthGauge is a Python library providing a framework in which to evaluate
synthetically generated data.

The library provides a range of metrics and visualisations for assessing and comparing distributions of features between real and synthetic data. At its core is the `Evaluator` object providing a consistant interface to applying a range of metrics to the data. By creating several `Evaluator` instances you can easily evaluate synthetic data generated from a range of methods in a consistent and comparable manner.


## Privacy vs. Utility
:lock: vs. :bar_chart:

When generating synthetic data there is generally a tradeoff between privacy (i.e. keeping sensitive information private) and utility (i.e. ensuring the dataset is still fit for purpose).

The metrics included in SynthGauge fall into these categories and work is continuing add more metrics.

## Mission Statement

SynthGauge **is** a toolkit providing metrics and visualisations that aid the user in the assessment of their synthetic data.

SynthGauge **is not** going to make any decisions on behalf of the user. It wonâ€™t specify if one synthetic dataset is better than another. This decision is dataset- and purpose-dependent so can vary widely from user to user.

It is a **decision-support tool**, not a decision-making tool.

## Getting Started

### Install

The ``synthgauge`` package is not currently available on PyPI. However it can be installed directly from GitHub. The package is configured using `pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg` files which require newer versions of `pip`, `setuptools` and `wheel`. Be sure to update these if you havent for a while!

```bash
    pip3 install -U pip setuptools wheel
    pip3 install git+https://github.com/datasciencecampus/synthgauge@main
```

Import the package and check the version:

```
    >>> import synthgauge
    >>> print(synthgauge.__version__)
    1.0.0
```
### Usage
To help users get acquainted example Jupyter Notebooks are included in the :open_file_folder: `synthgauge/examples` directory. New users are encouraged to work through `demo_notebook.ipynb`.

The following shows an example workflow for evaluating a single real/synthetic data pair.

```python
    import pandas as pd
    import synthgauge as sg

    # 1. Load real data into a Pandas DataFrame
    real_data = pd.read_csv('synth_eval/real.csv')

    # 2. Load corresponding synthetic data into Pandas Dataframe
    synth_data = pd.read_csv('synth_eval/synth.csv')

    # 3. Instantiate an Evaluator object
    E = sg.Evaluator(real_data, synth_data)

    # 4. Explore the data
    E.describe_categorical()
    ...

    E.plot_histograms(figsize=(12,12));
    ...

    # 5. Add metrics to compute
    E.add_metric('wasserstein','wass-age', feature='age')

    # 6. Evaluate the metrics
    eval_results = E.evaluate()

    # 7. Review results dictionary
    print(eval_results)
    {'wass-age': 1.46}
```
